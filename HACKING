Some notes on hacking the pam2control source.


* For processing all main structs/data_types used linked lists. Be careful
  with free(), since new objects can still need old memory areas.


* For small debuging stuff functions debug(), debug_addr() and debug_int()
  could be used. The differences are data types of arguments.
  debug() can operate with multiply number of arguments. First argument of
  debug() is (int) number of strings (char *), following after it.
  Functions debug_addr() and debug_int() take only two arguments: pointer
  or integer and string.
  To switch p2c to the debug modus - add 'debug' to the end of p2c line in
  /etc/pam.d/<PAM> file.


* Function rmn() takes a pointer as an argument and returns the same pointer.
  It's not really necessary, but helps to be more function.


* Function prototypes should not have variable names associated with the
  types; i.e.,
      void	func(int);
  not
      void	func(int a);


* Avoid typedefs ending in “_t”, except as specified in Standard C or by
  POSIX.


* The function type should be on a line by itself preceding the function.
      static char *
      func(char *str, char *foo, char *bar)
      {
