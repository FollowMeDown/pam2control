# pam2control
Yet another PAM project implemented in C and developed for fun.

pam2control is an amazing world of the memory leaks, collections of NULL
pointers and, of course, doors to nowhere... extremely surprising and very
impressive things heppen here.
Wanna have a lot of fun? Ready for adventure? Ð¡ome with me and I will
show you how deep is this rabbit hole ;-)
